**This site is very simple. And bold. And colorful. And big!**  

Its primary purpose is to showcase various technqiues shown in the class titled [The Basics of Web-Design Layout: Learn How To Describe Your Design With HTML & CSS](http://skl.sh/2FKWcgJ)

**In the class we cover the following topics:**

- Padding
- Margins
- Borders
- TranslateX and Y
- HTML & CSS terminology
- Lots of examples
- A walkthrough of creating a web page, where I show that you donâ€™t have to be really good at numbers, or know absolutely everything about developing websites. We debug. We Google for things. We try things out.
